# Luminex Project Meta  
This repository is the Meta-Repository for the Luminex Project (Distributed Resource Sharing System).

## 0. Introduction  
Servers that provide high-performance computing or require continuous connectivity and availability demand substantial computing power. Tasks like web hosting, data analysis, and AI inference necessitate varying levels of computing resources, often supplied by cloud servers. However, relying on cloud servers can result in high long-term costs.

For individuals or small organizations, setting up a server independently poses challenges, such as technical issues like single points of failure (SPoF) and high initial investment costs.

While Ethereum Smart Contracts offer decentralized environments, they are not well-suited for handling complex computations or hosting services. Similarly, systems like the Golem Network primarily focus on specific computational tasks, such as rendering or data analysis, and are less applicable for hosting services like web hosting.

To address these issues, the Luminex: DRS (Distributed Resource Sharing System) is proposed. DRS is a container-based resource-sharing platform that leverages distributed resources to support not only high-performance computing but also web hosting and other services. This system facilitates efficient resource utilization without relying on cloud servers, and its container-based architecture enables easy deployment. Moreover, it offers potential cost savings compared to traditional cloud solutions.
